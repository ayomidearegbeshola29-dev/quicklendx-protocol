  ## Developer tooling

  This repo ships a `Justfile` with a self-documenting `help` target. Run it
  (no arguments, or `just help`) to list every available developer recipe:

  ```bash
  just            # equivalent to `just help` — lists all recipes
  just help       # same as above
  just build      # cargo build --workspace
  just test       # cargo test --workspace
  just clippy     # cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
  just fmt-check  # cargo fmt --all -- --check
  just build-wasm # cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
  ```

  `scripts/check-justfile.sh` asserts the `help` target lists recipes and that
  unknown recipes fail; it runs automatically in CI on every Justfile change.

  ## Contribution

  Please follow the repository guidelines in  AGENTS.md  and include tests for any behavior changes.

  ### Frontend
